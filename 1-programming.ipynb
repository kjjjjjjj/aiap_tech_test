    "- Functions \"ones\" takes care of 1-19, because the teens do not follow the rules of above 20s. Example Thirteen, Twelve, etc..\n",
    "- Function \"tens\" takes care of 20-99. The num_dict dictionary is designed such that it is able to take care of all combinations. Example 36, there is a Thirty and a Five in the dictionary. Therefore, the dictionary key is the number itself, if its a tenth position it calls the tenth position in dictionary, else it calls the ones location. This way it will smartly join Thirty Six together.\n",
    "- Function \"hundreds\", the 1st digit follows the rules of 'ones'. Example 239 is Two (1st digit), follow by word \"Hundred\", so you get 'Two Hundred'. Then the 2nd and 3rd digits follows the tens rule, where 39 is Thirty Nine. Therefore calling function 'ones' and 'tens' comes in handy.\n",
    "- Function 'three_digit' calls all 3 functions above according to any 3 figures that throws at it. I do this because we can break a 6 figure down into 1st 3 digits set and last 3 digit set, as both sets follows the same conversion rules. Therefore, handling last 3 digit (below 1000), is the same as handling the 1st 3 digit set with a word \"Thousands\" added. \n",
    "Example 929852, we break to 2x sets, [929] and [852] sets. So we get [929] taken care by function 'hundreds' then add a word \"Thousand\", then [852] converted by function 'hundreds'.\n",
    "- Function 'commas_and' takes care of correct placement of commas and word 'and' when numbers is at the thousands.\n",
    "- Function englishify is where it puts everything above together smartly, ie. 'three_digit' and 'commas_add'. \n"
